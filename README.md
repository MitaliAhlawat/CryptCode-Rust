Project Introduction: Encryption/ Decryption program using...

Technical Overview:

Possible Challenges:
- Learning how to use and understand the interface of a new Rust cryptography crate (e.g., aes, rsa, ring).
- Handling Rust-specific concepts like ownership, lifetimes, and byte/string conversions.
- Understanding and correctly implementing secure key management practices.
- Debugging and testing encrypted data, since incorrect encryption/decryption often doesnâ€™t throw clear errors.
